    <h1>The main backstory of the idea of the game:</h1>
<hr>
    <h2><mark>I was always interested of making a game when I was the age of 8. I'm still really young to make a successful game like various games in Roblox like Epic Minigames, Arsenal and many more.<br> Unfortunately, I had an attention span of a goldfish. Maybe even a child that is in the age of 2 had a greater attention span than me. Then I almost dropped my idea of being successful developer. 1 year passed, I totally forgot about the idea. Untill, I saw that one of my friends was making a game. A game that was so simple but yet had so much potential.<mark> </h2>

    <h3>Then this game sparked my idea of my old dreams.<br> Then I decided I was going to fulfill my dreams without any hesitation.<i> I then taught of a simple idea that had so much potential, and that is when the idea of the game "Capture The Flag!" was born. </h3>
    <h4>Now, I'm 11. I did not have that much experience with scripting. However, with my imagination, I thought of many great maps and ideas for the game. The store, the animations, it was very exciting to think about my game and my tremendous amount of ideas. However, I knew this was going to take time to squeeze all my ideas into one game. I still gave it a shot.<mark> The game is still currently in development but I'm sure it will be viral one day.<mark></h4>
